### creating tables


# ID_user, user_name, group, template_data, signup_date expressed in UNIX time
# group works as linux privileges work, in this case:
# 0111 means first number is admin, second is group 1, third is group 2, fourth is group 3...
# So this user is not admin, but is a user of the three first groups

# with access 1, he will be allowed access.

# even if the user is in a different group with acess 1

### inserting example data

with open("template.dat", 'rb') as output:
	buffer = output.read(498)
	user = (1, 'David LÃ³pez Chica', 1, buffer, 0)
	cursor.execute("INSERT INTO users VALUES (?,?,?,?,?)", user)
	conn.commit()
	output.close()
			   
conn.close()
sys.exit()
